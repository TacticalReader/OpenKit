## 📖 About

**OpenKit** solves a simple problem: preparing and optimizing images for the web is usually slow, ad-riddled, and requires uploading your files to some third-party server.

This toolkit does it all **entirely in your browser**. No backend, no file uploads, no accounts, no limits — just fast, private image processing powered by the Canvas API.

> 🔒 Your files never leave your device. Everything runs client-side.

## 🚀 Getting Started

OpenKit is a static site — no build step, no dependencies to install.

### Option 1: Try it live

👉 **[Open the live demo](https://tacticalreader.github.io/OpenKit/)**

### Option 2: Run it locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/TacticalReader/OpenKit.git

# Move into the project directory
cd OpenKit

# Serve it locally (pick one)
python3 -m http.server 8000
# or
npx serve .
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

You can also just open `index.html` directly in a browser — no server required for basic use.
